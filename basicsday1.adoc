== Case Study: Subscription Analytics and Recommendations

=== Objective
Perform advanced data analysis on customer subscriptions, focusing on:

1. Enumerating subscription plans and customers.
2. Utilizing comprehensions to filter and transform subscription data.
3. Zipping lists to align customer IDs with subscription plans and revenues.
4. Applying functions and lambda functions to calculate statistics and derive insights.

----
# Step 1: Define the raw data for customers and their subscriptions.
customer_ids = [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, None, 107, 108, "109", 110]
subscription_plans = ["Basic", "Premium", "Premium", "Basic", "Gold", "Gold", None, "Basic", "Basic", "Gold"]
monthly_revenue = [15.0, 45.0, 45.0, 15.0, 70.0, 70.0, "N/A", 15.0, 15.0, -10.0]
active_status = [True, True, False, True, True, True, False, True, "yes", True]  # Mixed and inconsistent data
----

=== Cleaning Dirty Data

[source,python]
----
def clean_data(customer_ids, subscription_plans, monthly_revenue, active_status):
    cleaned_data = []
    for i in range(len(customer_ids)):
        try:
            customer_id = int(customer_ids[i]) if customer_ids[i] else None
            plan = subscription_plans[i] if subscription_plans[i] in ["Basic", "Premium", "Gold"] else None
            revenue = float(monthly_revenue[i]) if isinstance(monthly_revenue[i], (int, float)) and float(monthly_revenue[i]) > 0 else None
            active = True if str(active_status[i]).lower() in ["true", "yes"] else False
            if customer_id and plan and revenue is not None:
                cleaned_data.append((customer_id, plan, revenue, active))
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            continue
    return cleaned_data

cleaned_data = clean_data(customer_ids, subscription_plans, monthly_revenue, active_status)
print("\nCleaned Data:")
print(cleaned_data)
----

=== Enumerate Cleaned Data

[source,python]
----
enumerated_data = list(enumerate(cleaned_data))
print("\nEnumerated Cleaned Data:")
for index, details in enumerated_data:
    print(f"Index: {index}, Details: {details}")
----

=== Filter Active Subscriptions

[source,python]
----
active_customers = [customer for index, customer in enumerated_data if customer[3]]
print("\nActive Customers:")
print(active_customers)
----

=== Group Customers by Subscription Plan

[source,python]
----
customers_by_plan = {
    plan: [customer[0] for customer in active_customers if customer[1] == plan]
    for plan in set(subscription_plans) if plan is not None
}
print("\nCustomers Grouped by Plan:")
print(customers_by_plan)
----

=== Total Revenue for Active Subscriptions

[source,python]
----
total_active_revenue = sum([customer[2] for customer in active_customers])
print("\nTotal Active Revenue:", total_active_revenue)
----

=== Customer Revenue Mapping

[source,python]
----
customer_revenue_mapping = list(zip([customer[0] for customer in active_customers], [customer[2] for customer in active_customers]))
print("\nCustomer Revenue Mapping:")
print(customer_revenue_mapping)
----

=== Average Revenue and High Revenue Customers

[source,python]
----
def calculate_average_revenue(customers):
    revenues = [customer[2] for customer in customers]
    return sum(revenues) / len(revenues) if revenues else 0

def high_revenue_customers(customers, threshold):
    return [customer for customer in customers if customer[2] > threshold]

average_revenue = calculate_average_revenue(active_customers)
print("\nAverage Revenue from Active Customers:", average_revenue)

high_revenue_threshold = 30.0
high_revenue_active_customers = high_revenue_customers(active_customers, high_revenue_threshold)
print("\nHigh Revenue Active Customers:")
print(high_revenue_active_customers)
----

=== Insights for Inactive Customers

[source,python]
----
inactive_customers = [customer for customer in enumerated_data if not customer[1][3]]
print("\nInactive Customers:")
print(inactive_customers)
----

=== Reanalyze Churn Rate

[source,python]
----
def calculate_churn_rate(total_customers, active_customers):
    inactive_count = total_customers - len(active_customers)
    churn_rate = (inactive_count / total_customers) * 100
    return round(churn_rate, 2)

total_customers = len(cleaned_data)
churn_rate = calculate_churn_rate(total_customers, active_customers)
print(f"\nChurn Rate: {churn_rate}%")
----

=== Visualize Revenue Distribution

[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_revenue_distribution(customers):
    revenues = [customer[2] for customer in customers]
    plt.hist(revenues, bins=5, color='blue', alpha=0.7)
    plt.title("Revenue Distribution of Active Customers (Cleaned)")
    plt.xlabel("Revenue")
    plt.ylabel("Frequency")
    plt.show()

plot_revenue_distribution(active_customers)
----

=== Predict Future Revenue

[source,python]
----
def predict_future_revenue(current_revenue, growth_rate, months):
    return round(current_revenue * ((1 + growth_rate / 100) ** months), 2)

growth_rate = 5.0  # Assuming a 5% monthly growth rate
future_revenue = predict_future_revenue(total_active_revenue, growth_rate, 12)
print(f"\nPredicted Revenue for Next 12 Months: ${future_revenue}")
