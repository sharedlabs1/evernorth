== Case Study: Subscription Analytics and Recommendations

=== Objective
Perform advanced data analysis on customer subscriptions, focusing on:

1. Enumerating subscription plans and customers.
2. Utilizing comprehensions to filter and transform subscription data.
3. Zipping lists to align customer IDs with subscription plans and revenues.
4. Applying functions and lambda functions to calculate statistics and derive insights.

# Step 1: Define the raw data for customers and their subscriptions.
customer_ids = [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, None, 107, 108, "109", 110]
subscription_plans = ["Basic", "Premium", "Premium", "Basic", "Gold", "Gold", None, "Basic", "Basic", "Gold"]
monthly_revenue = [15.0, 45.0, 45.0, 15.0, 70.0, 70.0, "N/A", 15.0, 15.0, -10.0]
active_status = [True, True, False, True, True, True, False, True, "yes", True]  # Mixed and inconsistent data

=== Cleaning Dirty Data

[source,python]
----
def clean_data(customer_ids, subscription_plans, monthly_revenue, active_status):
    """
    Cleans the input data by performing the following steps:
    1. Converts customer IDs to integers where possible; skips entries with invalid or missing IDs.
    2. Ensures subscription plans belong to a valid set ("Basic", "Premium", "Gold"); invalid plans are set to None.
    3. Converts monthly revenue to a positive float; skips entries with invalid or negative revenues.
    4. Converts active status to a boolean; accepts "True", "Yes" (case-insensitive) as active, all else as inactive.
    5. Appends only valid data entries (with no None values) to the cleaned data list.

    Parameters:
    - customer_ids: List of customer IDs.
    - subscription_plans: List of subscription plans.
    - monthly_revenue: List of monthly revenue values.
    - active_status: List of subscription statuses.

    Returns:
    - A cleaned list of tuples containing valid customer data.

=== Filter Active Subscriptions

# This ensures only valid and currently active records are included in revenue calculations,
# customer segmentation, and predictive analytics, preventing skewed results caused by inactive records.

=== Visualize Revenue Distribution

[source,python]
----
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Matplotlib is used here to create a histogram for revenue distribution.
# It is an effective library for generating visual insights, allowing us to:
# 1. Quickly understand the frequency distribution of revenue values.
# 2. Identify patterns or anomalies, such as clusters or gaps.
# 3. Share visual results with stakeholders for better data communication.

=== Predict Future Revenue
